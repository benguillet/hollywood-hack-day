hollywood-hack-day
==================

A project for the Hollywood Hack Day.

VideoList lets you easily save videos, from the main platforms such as Youtube, Dailymotion andVvimeo, via a Chrome extension, in order for you to watch them later. You can then share this videos with your facebook friends, watch the videos shared by your friends or share this videos to everybody on the platform. When you first connect, you can import all the videos that you posted on your facebook wall. You can also vote up or down on each video.

Despite the fact that it was our first hackathon, this project finished 3rd among 24 projects and about 90 developers.
